Have you ever shared a link from a popular website to a friend or colleage on a big social platform like X(formerly Twitter), Facebook or discord and suddently a cool preview of the website appears with a thumbnail, a title and a description of the websites content? something which would look more or less like this:

-- insert image --

this is thanks to a technology called opengraph, it's a stardarndized metadata protocol; or in plain English: it helps sharing you content online with a more clear purpose. Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Whatsapp, Telegram and other big platforms will be able to read the content of your website beforehand, and it will display that information in your post or message.

sharing links with a proper open graph protocol is definitely way better than just a common underlined and blue url, specially if you are planning to sell products or services online.

Most users go speed reading through their feed and even if they spot the link to the product you are selling, there is a chance they won't click on it. nowadays people are worried more than ever of clicking the wrong link and getting their information stolen by some shady hacker, we want to be trusted by users and one of the easiest ways to earn it is by displaying what we are sharing is about beforehand.
